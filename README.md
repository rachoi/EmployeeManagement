# About

Created while following along the youtube series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGRDMO4rOGcNLnW1L2vgsExTBg-VPoZHr, 
and with personal knowledge of React and Spring Boot from other resources. 

Adjusted the project to have other features than the tutorial provided, such as:

- Employee clocking in (tracking when the employee clocks in and out of work),
- Ability to check whether or not the the employee is currently at work (clocked in)
- Adjusted the CSS to match personal preferences of how I wanted it to look like. 

Future plans with the project:

Add user authetication to limit access to certain parts of the application:
ie, employees can only view page that allows them to clock in and out of work,
only admin has access to add, update, delete, or view other employees, etc. 

Add ways to upload an image to contain an employee's picture for the profile matched with their ID.

Better UI.
